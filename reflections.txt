How long did you spend working on this project?

    more than 5 days

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

    making ruby gem

Where do you still have room to grow?

    work more on metaprograming and send

    trying to understand why

    def self.sample_colors
      colors.each { |color| puts "This is " + "#{color}".send(color) }
    end

    def self.sample_colors
      colors.each { |color| puts "This is " + "#{color}".red }
    end

    these work and not this

    def self.sample_colors
      colors.each { |color| puts "This is " + "#{color}".color }
    end
